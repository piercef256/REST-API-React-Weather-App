# weather-app-react

Technologies used: React.js, REST API, Bootstrap, Flexbox, AWS Amplify.

- Weather forecasting app built using “Weather API” REST API and React.js. Deployed using AWS Amplify CI/CD (my AWS free trial ended, so I deleted the live AWS app, but added instructions to run locally).
- Users can get weather data from specific locations and toggle displaying temperatures in Fahrenheit, or Celsius.
- Weather API link: https://www.weatherapi.com/
- To run the app locally, get your own api key from https://www.weatherapi.com/ and add it to a new .env file in the client folder using the following format: REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY, then cd into the client folder and run the `npm start` command.
